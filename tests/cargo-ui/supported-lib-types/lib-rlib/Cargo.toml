# This still works for a fresh build and it only prints a warning. Thus, we
# force rebuild for now.

# Note that support for this case is deprecated. AFAIK, there is no plan to fix
# cargo build cache for cases like this. Until then, we might as well check that
# our support level matches cargo's.
